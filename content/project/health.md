title="Predictive modelling for critical patient events using healthcare data"

summary="Predicting clinical outcomes using longitudinal electronic health record (EHRs) data is a clinically important and computationally challenging task. In this projects, we are working on predicting adverse events like patient death, bleeding, or heart failure using carefully extracted features from patient records."
