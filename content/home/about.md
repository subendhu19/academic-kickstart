# Biography

I am a first year computer science graduate student at UMass Amherst. My research consists of two major tracks. I work with Prof. Hong Yu on healthcare applications of machine learning. I also work with Prof. Yuriy Brun and Prof. Arjun Guha on projects in the intersection of software engineering and programming languages. 

My current project with Prof. Hong is on reliable and interpretable prediction of critical patient events like mortality, bleeding, and heart failure, using electronic health records. Our most recent submission from this work was in the BOOM workshop at IJCAI-ECAI 2018.

With Prof. Yuriy and Prof. Arjun, I am working on a code completion tool for the formal verification language - Coq.
